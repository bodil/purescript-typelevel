# purescript-typelevel

Type level natural numbers and booleans.

This package is a direct port of the Haskell [type-level](https://github.com/forsyde/type-level) package by Acosta, Kiselyov, Jeltsch et al. The original BSD 3-clause licence is preserved for this derivative work.

## Type Level Numbers

This package provides a way to represent type level natural natural and whole numbers with a useful set of operations for them.

A natural number is expressed at the type level using symbols (type level strings). For example `NProxy "2"` represents 2 and `NProxy "1337"` represents 1337. Values of each type can be created using `d2 = NProxy :: NProxy "2"` or simply `d2 = NProxy::_ "2"`.

Two type classes are provided acting as sets: `Nat` is the set of natural numbers (zero to infinity), and `Pos` is the set of positive numbers (1 to infinity). `Nat` defines the function `reflectInt`, which converts type level numbers to the value level. To move integer values to the type level, use the `reifyInt` function (which will throw a runtime exception for values which are not natural numbers).

### Whole Numbers

`IProxy "-20` represents the whole number -20 and `IProxy "20"` represents the whole number 20.

### Applying Operations

You can express arithmetic operators as type class constraints on type level numbers. For instance, to express that a type `c` is the sum of types `a` and `b`, you would use the type signature `∀ a b c. (Nat a, Nat b, Add a b c) ⇒ a → b → c`. To express that a type `a` must be less than another type `b`, you would use the type signature `∀ a b. (Nat a, Nat b, Lt a b) ⇒ a → b`.

Most of these constraints are fully relational, so that (even though a `Sub` constraint exists) you could make `c` the result of subtracting `b` from `a` by saying `∀ a b c. (Add c b a) ⇒ a → b → c`.

Note that while most of the arithmetic operations are reasonably performant, division (`DivMod` and friends) is not: division with a three digit divisor takes more than five minutes to type check on my machine.
